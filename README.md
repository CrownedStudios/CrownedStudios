# 👋 Welcome to CrownedStudios

Hello and welcome!

You've discovered the "CrownedStudios" account. 

I initially thought I had lost access to my previous account, [CrownedStudioss](https://github.com/CrownedStudioss), and ended up creating this one. To be honest, I'm not entirely sure how it happened, but please be aware that the other account is impersonating me in some way. 😅

## 📂 About Me

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Forked Repositories:** The forked repositories on this account are older projects related to Discord that I am no longer actively maintaining. They are provided as-is and are not expected to be updated further.
  
- **Impersonation Warning:** Any GitHub account with a name other than "CrownedStudios" or "CrownedStudioss" is not associated with me. Please be cautious and ensure you are interacting with the correct accounts.

Thank you for stopping by!

Best regards,
