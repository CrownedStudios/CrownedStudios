# 👋 Welcome to CrownedStudios

Hello and welcome!

You’ve discovered the **CrownedStudios** account. I initially created this account because I thought I had lost access to my previous account, [CrownedStudioss](https://github.com/CrownedStudioss). Both accounts are associated with me, and there is no impersonation involved. 😅

## 📂 About Me

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Forked Repositories:** The forked repositories on this account are older projects related to Discord that I am no longer actively maintaining. They are provided as-is and will not be updated further.

Thank you for stopping by!

Best regards,
